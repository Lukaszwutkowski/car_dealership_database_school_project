2.	Sales Management: The system records all sales transactions, enabling tracking of vehicles sold, sales prices, and assigning sales to specific dealership employees, which allows for analysis of sales performance.

3.	Customer Information: The database stores detailed information about customers, including their contact and address details, facilitating customer relationship building and management of marketing activities.

4.	Service and Maintenance: The system allows for the recording and management of service actions performed on vehicles, including service dates, descriptions of work done, and costs.

5.	Audit and Monitoring: With an `AuditLog` table, the project provides the capability to track significant changes in the database, thereby increasing security and user accountability.â€ƒ
