-- The task of the procedure is to update the price of a car in the Inventories table.
-- The procedure first checks whether the car with the given VIN exists in the Inventories table before proceeding to update the price.
-- After changing the price, the procedure records the operation in the AuditLog table (thanks to the previously created trigger, which is located in the 'Triggers' section).
